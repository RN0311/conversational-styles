# Conversational Styles
This repository contains features engineered from the transcripts of spoken conversations from the SwitchBoard datasets. I calculated various linguistic, paralinguistics, and acoustic features to understand 
The conversation's style and classification of which conversation falls under high consideration and high involvement, as per Deborah Tannen's theory. 

Note: This repository is just a fraction of my work in sociolinguistics and NLP at the University of San Francisco. The rest of the codebase is maintained in the MAGICS Lab code repository. To learn more about the MAGICS lab, visit the [link]( https://magics.cs.usfca.edu/people/)!

This infographic shows that men have a high loudness rate compared to women, and women tend to have a high pitch compared to me! Also, a bunch of other exciting findings are documented in our AACL 2022 abstract.
